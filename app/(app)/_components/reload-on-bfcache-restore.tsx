/**
 * Works around client-side navigation dying after a page is restored from firefox's back/forward cache. When a click
 * which leaves for another site also updates react state - closing the navigation menu, say - react's scheduler posts a
 * `MessageChannel` message to run that work. Firefox freezes the page before the message is delivered, and drops it, so
 * after restoring the page the scheduler believes its work loop is still running and never schedules another one.
 * Discrete updates, like opening a menu, still render, but transitions - and with them every router navigation - never
 * do. The page is reloaded instead. `persisted` is only set when coming back from another document, never on the
 * router's own back/forward navigation.
