 * An image's or a block's caption and, for an image, the licence its asset carries - or nothing when it has neither.
 *
 * The licence is part of the caption rather than a line of its own because it is a credit for the image above it, and
 * because an image may carry a licence without carrying a caption.
 *
 * Set as the typography plugin sets a caption inside prose (see `RichTextContent`), since it sits between paragraphs of
 * it: a step below the 18px body text, and in the plugin's caption gray, lighter than the body's - so it reads as a
 * note on the image rather than as another paragraph.
 *
 * Its links - the caption's own and the licence's - are underlined, since in the caption's colour nothing else tells
 * them from the text around them; on hover the underline thickens and the link darkens to the body's colour.
