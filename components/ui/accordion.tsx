/**
 * An accordion content block, as native disclosures.
 *
 * `details`/`summary` rather than a scripted disclosure: an accordion in an article is content, and content a reader
 * cannot open until javascript arrives - or at all, if it never does - is worse than one without an animation. It also
 * keeps find-in-page working, which browsers implement by opening the `details` holding the match.
 *
 * The title is a real heading inside the `summary` - which the html spec allows there precisely for this - so an
 * accordion's sections appear in the heading outline a screen reader user navigates an article by. A bare `summary` is
 * announced as a summary, and its sections would be missing from that outline entirely.
 *
 * `h3` because an accordion is a block inside an item's content, under the `h1` of the page and any `h2` the prose
 * around it sets - the level cannot be derived from where the block sits, so it is fixed at the one level which is
 * correct for every current caller.
 *
 * No `name` attribute, so several items may be open at once: they are independent sections, and closing one to read
 * another loses the reader's place for no reason.
